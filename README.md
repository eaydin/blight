#blight

Blight is simply a color scheme, especially for Sublime. Probably will change some stuff in time.

Created with the great tool at https://tmtheme-editor.herokuapp.com

Especially didn't create a pull request since I'm planning on changing this quiet often.

So simply add this line to your "Settings - User" file in Sublime to use it:

`"color_scheme": "Path/to/Blight.tmTheme"`
